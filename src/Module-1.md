### Given the text, it resolves mentions (typically pronouns) to the entity they refer to in the text. To facilitate entity resolution, we prepend each Description component with the Character Cues component which appears before it in the screenplay (e.g. [character]MARTHA: [dialog]“I knew it!” [description]She then jumps triumphantly → MARTHA. She then jumps triumphantly).
