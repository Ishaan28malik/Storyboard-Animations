# Conclusion and Future Work
### The system uses linguistic text simplification techniques to map screenplay text to animation. Evaluating such systems is a challenge. Nevertheless, intrinsic and extrinsic evaluations show reasonable performance of the system. The proposed system is not perfect, for example, the current system does not take into account the discourse information that links the actions implied in the text, as currently the system only processes sentences independently. In the future, we would like to leverage discourse information by considering the sequence of actions which are described in the text (Modi and Titov, 2014; Modi, 2016). This would also help to resolve ambiguity in text with regard to actions (Modi et al., 2017; Modi, 2017). Moreover, our system can be used for generating training data which could be used for training an end-to-end neural system.
